Instructions:

1. Place downloaded contents in the root of your kernel source

2. When you have compiled the i9505/i9505g kernel successfully, enter:

./build_bootimg (this will start the script, now you will need to choose the rom type)

 [1] JB v4.2.x - TouchWiz (All Stock-based ROMS)
 [2] JB v4.2.x - CM 10.1
 [3] JB v4.2.x - AOSP (Google Edition)
 [4] JB v4.3.x - AOSP (Google Edition)

Choose the rom type and the boot.img file is created for the chosen rom type.

3. Enter: ./flash_bootimg to flash the boot.img to your device.

>> Make sure you have enabled debugging mode on your phone (in developer options) <<

The boot.img will automatically be flashed to your phone. 

After the process you get the option whether to push the generated modules to your device or not.

Additionally you can wipe dalvik-cache before it reboots your phone.
